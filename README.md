Predictions on the Numerai Dataset 

Numerai is a crowd-sourced hedge fund where data scientists make stock market predictions on a dataset made available weekly. Here, their sell-out is the supply of clean dataset. So, there will be no need for data cleaning and feature engineering which consumes over seventy percent of the data scientist’s time. Unlike other platforms, the dataset is encrypted, so, you’ll be working on fifty features, made available in a digital format.
